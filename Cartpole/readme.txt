#Instruction about how to run the codes.
#This folder contains three python files: Qtabular.py for Tabular Q-learnin; DQNtorch.py for Deep Q-learning; MCPG.py for Monte-Carlo policy gradient
# We set good parameters in our codes. If you want to repeat all the experiments we showed in our report, read the code and change values of parameters. We have given hints in comments.
